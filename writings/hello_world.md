### Introduction

Here I am, writing my first post on my very own personal page. I must say upfront, I'm not a master web developer, and it doesn't seem like that's going to change anytime soon. I mean, Django and Flask are so cool; I really enjoy working with them. If web development were just about that, I would definitely be part of that world. But reality isn't that simple. Yes, I'm looking at you, JavaScript. I'm not going to spend romantic nights with you.

### Goals

I spend a lot of time learning. Like, a lot. So, why not put everything I discover in one place where I can read about it later and proudly say to myself, "Well, today I know even more about this." Books and writing have been an important part of my life since I was young, so this might also be a place to sharpen my writing skills.

### Content

I don't want to set any barriers for myself, especially since blog culture is going extinct, and this page isn't going to change that trend. So, what am I going to write about? Whatever I feel like sharing and exploring. It will probably be mostly about technology, science, and the aerospace industry, but who knows?

### Final Thoughts

Will this page survive more than a few posts made in 10 minutes? Maybe yes, maybe no. I hope to leave a nice mark on the internet before it crashes or we all perish. If you ever feel the need to contact me, my email (d.stasiak115@gmail.com) is open whenever you want, and I'm always up for a chat or anything else.
