#intro
i have just come back from my vacation trip with parents in cyprus, and decided to share some cool stories and photographs

after kind of hiatus i've make a goal to make 100 photos during my academia vacation. Well, if you do photos you probably know that 100 is really really low, unless we talking about nearly perfect photos that you edit and the post somewhere, but i wasnt even thinking about post edit when i was setting up this goal. So... i probably made them in one day. And this was enough to remind me of love to photography that i lost someday. So during this trip i wanted to make lot of photos, and as a big fan of animal photography which is my favourite one to making, i must said that cyprus is amazing place. Cats everywhere

#cats
there is a special specie of cat, called cyprus cats, that you can find everywhere. In contrast to my ragdoll cat, their hair is short, and they maybe not small, but definetly thin. Which makes perfectly sense because they live in a place that for me is like hell. Sometimes i felt like im burring allive. For some people that must be a big plus, but for me? No way. Some data that i found in internet said, that therse more cats than people on cyprus island. My only hope is that they living fun and good live. The once that i met was the calmest cats i have ever met, and was purfects model waiting for me to make the photo, and then going away. 

#sea
As i ve said this place for person like me was a hell. I like warm, but not the hot. During our trip with guide she said that the official temperature that are shown are always lower than the real one, because there is a law that said that people can't work while temperature is higher than 40 celscius, and that would stop whole country for last two months, cause while we was there, she said it's going be finally first time dropping to normal 35 degrees. I tried to go running with my dad one day, and after 2 km i decided to stop and just walk. It was really hard. Harder than the legendary may 2024 silesia half marathon. But the sea was amazing. I spent lots of time in the sea and swim for few hours nearly everyday. And still, the only doms that i got was the legs one after the 3.5km run/walk. Need to hit legs this season more often i guess.

#tombs
Showing some photos of place i visit i've got you some ancient desert vibes. There wasn't much to visit in the place where i was, but there are two realy cool place that i want to share. First is the tombs of kings, which was made beetwen IV p.n.e to III n.e. There is funny story about the name, because this was necropoly for high aristocrats, no king was burried there. I'm big fan of ancient times, so it was pleasing experience, same goes for the theatre.

#aphrodite
The second amazing place that i have visited, is a aphrodite rock. And no lies, this is one of the most beautifull landscape i have seen i my life. No photo can show you how perfect is the view there, you must see its in real life.
