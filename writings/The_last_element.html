            <h2 id="introduction" class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
            <a>Have you ever wondered what lies beyond the edge of the periodic table? The superheavy elements are those with atomic numbers greater than 103. These elements exist for mere fractions of a second, yet they're helping us unlock the secrets of the atomic world.</a>

            <h2 id="goals" class="subtitle">The heaviest known (right now) element: Oganesson</h2>
            <a>The heaviest known (right now) element: Oganesson
                In 2016, element 118, named oganesson, became the latest addition to the periodic table. Despite being classified as a noble gas, oganesson breaks all the rules. The funniest thing is that oganesson is predicted to be solid at room temperature. This bizarre behavior is due to Einstein's theory of relativity. In superheavy atoms, electrons move so fast they gain significant mass, dramatically altering the element's properties.</a>

            <h2 id="content" class="subtitle">Content</h2>
            <a>I don't want to set any barriers for myself, especially since blog culture is going extinct, and this page isn't going to change that trend. So, what am I going to write about? Whatever I feel like sharing and exploring. It will probably be mostly about technology, science, and the aerospace industry, but who knows?</a>

            <h3 id="final-thoughts" class="subtitle">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <a>Will this page survive more than a few posts made in 10 minutes? Maybe yes, maybe no. I hope to leave a nice mark on the internet before it crashes or we all perish. If you ever feel the need to contact me, my email (d.stasiak115@gmail.com) is open whenever you want, and I'm always up for a chat or anything else.</a>
