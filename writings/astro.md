# Discovering Astro: The Lightweight Web Framework for Content-Driven Websites

## Introduction

I have to admit, I’ve never been a huge fan of web development — though that might have more to do with the current state of web dev than the concept itself. One of my biggest frustrations is the constant influx of new frameworks. It seems like every month there's another "industry standard", and suddenly recruiters are looking for experts with five years of experience in a tool that’s only been out for six months.

In contrast, I’m a fan of more stable technologies. Take C, for example. It's been around for over 50 years, and while some might call it a dinosaur, it’s still going strong with relatively few changes. I enjoy working with those old but reliable tools, even if they require a bit of archeology to dig into their old bones.

So why am I writing about a web development framework, you ask? Well, I’ve recently found one that actually makes web development easier and, dare I say, fun! It’s called Astro, - the name is very important and as I am aerospace engineering student.

## What is Astro?

According to its official description, Astro is a web framework designed for content-driven websites. But what does that really mean? In essence, it’s a static site generator that takes your content and turns it into fast, optimized websites. And my favorite line from their website?

Zero JavaScript, by default.

As someone who’s not a fan of JavaScript, this is music to my ears. But sometimes i like to pust some react into my site, and Astro doesn’t stop there—it’s flexible enough to let you use your favorite tools like mentioned react, Vue, Solid, Svelte, or Preact when needed. If that's your preference, by default it suggest you to choose TypeScript.

## Components and Layouts: Building with Flexibility

In Astro, websites are built from layouts and components. Both are written in .astro files, but don’t worry—it’s not a new language. These components, also called "islands," are the building blocks of your site. The beauty of this system is that each island is isolated, yet seamlessly integrated into the final page, allowing you to mix and match technologies.

Here’s an example of a basic Astro component:

astro

---
// Include your scripts and imports here
import ReactComponent from '../components/ReactComponent.jsx';
const { title } = Astro.props;
---

<!-- HTML structure goes here -->
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>{title}</p>

<ReactComponent client:visible />

With this setup, you can mix React components, Solid.js snippets, or whatever else you prefer, making Astro extremely adaptable for various development styles.

## Why I Enjoy Using Astro

What I appreciate most about Astro is how it simplifies things. It doesn’t try to be an all-encompassing solution with a steep learning curve, but rather a tool that brings order to the chaos of modern web development. The emphasis on efficiency is remarkable, and I’ve found it extremely satisfying to work with.

I’m currently in the process of rebuilding my personal website using Astro, and I’m particularly excited about its support for .md (Markdown) files. I love writing my blog posts and articles in Markdown, and I’ve heard that Astro excels at converting these files into polished web content with minimal effort. I will be testing that thing soon.

## Final Thoughts

Astro strikes a balance between simplicity and power, offering flexibility without unnecessary complexity. It’s ideal for developers who want to focus on content-driven sites while maintaining a clean and efficient workflow. If you’re looking for a web framework that gives you control without overwhelming you with options, Astro might just be what you need.
