        <h1 class="title">About me</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">I'm currently a second-year <b>Aerospace Engineering</b> student and a first-year <b>Physics student at the Silesian University of Technology</b>. My journey into the world of technology and science started early, fueled by a deep curiosity and a love for computers. As a child, I spent countless hours trying to create computer games and writing funny applications with friends. Those early experiments sparked a passion that has only grown over the years. <br><br>

        Outside of academics, I'm an avid <b>sports enthusiast</b> — some might even say addicted. I've got experience in nearly every discipline, but my current favorites are tennis, triathlon, and martial arts. These sports not only keep me physically active but also teach me discipline, focus, and perseverance — qualities that I bring into my studies and projects.<br><br>
        
        But there's more to me than just technology and sports. I'm also deeply passionate about <b>literature and photography</b>. On my writing subpage, you'll find a collection of my thoughts, stories, and photographs — a glimpse into how I see the world.<br><br>
