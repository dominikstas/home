        <p class="subtitle">My name is Dominik and I'm a first year student at the <b>Silesian Technical University</b>.
            I've been into technology and computers for as long as I can remember. As a child, I tried to create computer games and write funny applications with my friends.
            But outside the world of programming, I'm interested in sports. Basically, there is no discipline that I have not practiced, but currently I am mainly training for triathlon and play tennis.
